# CMD Basic Commands

To use git in cmd we must know at least how to navigate through the directories and point to the correct project folder.

Most important commands:

## CD (Change Directory)

This command enables you to change the current directory or, in other words, to navigate to another folder from your PC.

```
cd C:\Users\[your_user_name]\Desktop
```

## DIR (Directory)

You can view the contents of a folder.

```
dir
```

## MKDIR (Make Directory)

If you want to create a folder that contains spaces in its name, make sure to wrap its name between quotes or apostrophes.

```
mkdir “My Folder”
```

## REN (Rename)

To rename a file, use the same command with the file extension.

```
ren Folder NewFolderName
```
