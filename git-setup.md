# Installing Git

Before you start using Git, you have to download it to your computer.

You can download it from the link:<br>

1. Review the GNU General Public License, and when you’re ready to install, click Next.

14. The default options are recommended, however this step allows you to decide which extra option you would like to enable. If you use symbolic links, which are like shortcuts for the command line, tick the box. Click Next.

15. Depending on the version of Git you’re installing, it may offer to install experimental features. At the time this article was written, the options to include support for pseudo controls and a built-in file system monitor were offered. Unless you are feeling adventurous, leave them unchecked and click Install.
